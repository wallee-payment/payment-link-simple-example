# Payment Links
This project contains multiple simple examples how to use payment links of the [wallee.com](https://wallee.com) payment platform.
Payment links allow to process payments without requiring a backend system to handle anything. They allow to process a form submit and
create out of it a payment. Below you find examples which show the usage of them.
